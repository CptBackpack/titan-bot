# titan-bot
Titan is a simple Discord bot developed to learn how Discord bots are made.

# usage
Download files (either by cloning or making your own fork).

First, run ``` npm run setup ``` to have the script create ```config.json``` for you, or rename ```config-template.json``` into ```config.json``` and fill it with your bot data.


Then, run  ```npm start``` and enjoy.

#### environment variables

```TITAN_TOKEN = the token of your bot```


# development
As of now there are no plans to turn Titan into a fully-fledged bot, but you never know.


### note
This bot is a personal project and not intended for use on other Discord servers.
